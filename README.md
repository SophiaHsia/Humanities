# What's this *Humanities* repository for?
- This repository restores everything about humanities learning. Most of them are the notes I taken in the online humanity/law/literature courses.
- I believe that we live for explore interesting things - and there's nothing more interesting and exciting than the wisdom and thinking created by human beings. As a programmer and designer, humanities courses always give me a place to rest and reflect myself, it's ths secret garden for me.
